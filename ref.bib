  abstract  = {The design of an omnidirectional octorotor (OmniOcta) is the scope of this article. The pose of the UAV's thrusters is computed via an optimization algorithm that guarantees the omnidirectionality of the platform. The thrusters' positions are restricted in a semispherical volume with different polar coordinates while their pose is determined in order to avoid the interaction between their propellers' air-funnels. The octorotor is manufactured using 3D printed parts and its employed electronics were selected so as to have the smallest weight. The number of thrusters was then selected as the minimal number that could lift the platform's weight in all rotation directions with the chosen electronic and aerodynamic components. Simulations were conducted to show the capacity of the UAV to lift its weight, while experiments were conducted to identify the allocation matrix of the constructed UAV.},
