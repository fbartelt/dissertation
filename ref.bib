  abstract      = {This paper introduces for the first time the design, modelling, and control of a novel morphing multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that we call the OmniMorph. The morphing ability allows the selection of the configuration that optimizes energy consumption while ensuring the needed maneuverability for the required task. The most energy-efficient uni-directional thrust (UDT) configuration can be used, e.g., during standard point-to-point displacements. Fully-actuated (FA) and omnidirectional (OD) configurations can be instead used for full pose tracking, such as, e.g., constant attitude horizontal motions and full rotations on the spot, and for full wrench 6D interaction control and 6D disturbance rejection. Morphing is obtained using a single servomotor, allowing possible minimization of weight, costs, and maintenance complexity. The actuation properties are studied, and an optimal controller that compromises between performance and control effort is proposed and validated in realistic simulations. Preliminary tests on the prototype are presented to assess the propellers' mutual aerodynamic interference.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a hybrid geometric control scheme for a system defined on a matrix Lie group in the form of a left-invariant vector field. Our solution to the point stabilization problem is coordinate free (or geometric). Specifically, we propose a hybrid geometric controller that uses a controller from a local class of geometric controllers and an open-loop geometric controller. Our method guarantees that the given point in the manifold is robustly globally asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system when each controller from the local geometric class is combined with the geometric open-loop controller using a hybrid systems framework.},

  abstract  = {The present article introduces the concept of a non-singular cooperative guiding vector field under a homotopy equivalence transformation. Initially, an innovative non-singular guiding vector field is derived, which is capable of guiding the controlled robot to follow a path in a moving frame. Furthermore, the properties of homotopy equivalence transformation are explored to establish the existence of the aforementioned vector field. Subsequently, a cooperative vector field, based on an extensive parameter consensus protocol, is introduced, including an in-depth analysis of the impact of vector field parameters. Then, the practical implementation of this innovative vector field is demonstrated through its application to cooperative path following in both 2-D and 3-D scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness. Finally, for a non-holonomic robot at constant speed, a moving path following control law based on the guiding vector field is presented, along with a discussion on speed constraint.},

  title         = {{Decentralized Adaptive Control for Collaborative Manipulation of Rigid Bodies}},
  journal       = {IEEE Transactions on Robotics},
  abstract      = {In this work, we consider a group of robots working together to manipulate a rigid object to track a desired trajectory in {\$}\backslashtext{\{}SE{\}}(3){\$}. The robots do not know the mass or friction properties of the object, or where they are attached to the object. They can, however, access a common state measurement, either from one robot broadcasting its measurements to the team, or by all robots communicating and averaging their state measurements to estimate the state of their centroid. To solve this problem, we propose a decentralized adaptive control scheme wherein each agent maintains and adapts its own estimate of the object parameters in order to track a reference trajectory. We present an analysis of the controller's behavior, and show that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, and that the system trajectory will almost always (except for initial conditions on a set of measure zero) converge to the desired trajectory. We study the proposed controller's performance using numerical simulations of a manipulation task in 3-D, as well as hardware experiments which demonstrate our algorithm on a planar manipulation task. These studies, taken together, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller even in the presence of numerous unmodeled effects, such as discretization errors and complex frictional interactions.},

  abstract      = {This work presents the mechanical design and control of a novel small-size and lightweight Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) for aerial manipulation. To our knowledge, with a total take-off mass of only 2.0 kg, the proposed system is the most lightweight Aerial Manipulator (AM) that has 8-DOF independently controllable: 5 for the aerial platform and 3 for the articulated arm. We designed the robot to be fully-actuated in the body forward direction. This allows independent pitching and instantaneous force generation, improving the platform's performance during physical interaction. The robotic arm is an origami delta manipulator driven by three servomotors, enabling active motion compensation at the end-effector. Its composite multimaterial links help reduce the weight, while their flexibility allow for compliant aerial interaction with the environment. In particular, the arm's stiffness can be changed according to its configuration. We provide an in depth discussion of the system design and characterize the stiffness of the delta arm. A control architecture to deal with the platform's overactuation while exploiting the delta arm is presented. Its capabilities are experimentally illustrated both in free flight and physical interaction, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of the origami's folding mechanism.},

First, the integral motion of constituent elements in a dynamic scene is captured by a common underlying geometric transform process. Second, a Lie algebraic representation of the transform process is introduced, which maps the transformation group to a vector space, and thus overcomes the difficulties due to the group structure. Consequently, the statistical learning techniques based on vector spaces can be readily applied. Moreover, we discuss the intrinsic connections between the Lie algebra and the Linear dynamical processes, showing that our model induces spatially varying fields that can be estimated from local motions without continuous tracking. Following this, we further develop a statistical framework to robustly learn the flow models from noisy and partially corrupted observations. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on real world phenomenon, inferring common motion patterns from surveillance videos of crowded scenes and satellite data of weather evolution.},

Synchronization is generally asymptotic, but if the Lie group is nilpotent, then synchronization is achieved at an exponential rate. We first linearize the synchronization error dynamics at identity, and show that the proposed controller achieves local exponential synchronization on any Lie group. Building on the local analysis, we show that if the Lie group is exponential, then synchronization is global.

This vector field is then integrated into a nonlinear controller designed via Backstepping with Integral Action to deal with the quadcopter vehicle dynamics and reject constant uncertainties. The considered vehicle model is based on quaternion algebra. The control inputs are considered to be the total thrust and torques.

  abstract  = {In this work, we present a methodology to compute an artificial time-varying vector field in {\$}n{\$} dimensions that defines trajectories that converge to and follow a given desired curve. The Euclidean distance function is used to construct the field, which is easily computed from a parametric representation of the curve. The computation of the time feedforward term to compensate for time dependence is such that its norm is limited by the maximum velocity of the curve. This fact allows the normalization of the time-varying vector field such that it has a constant norm without any negative effect for convergence. We present convergence proofs for the proposed normalized time-varying vector field and demonstrate the existence of ultimate bounds in the case bounded disturbances are present. Finally, we show several simulations and experiments with an actual quadrotor to validate our methodology.},

  abstract      = {Learning robot motions from demonstration requires models able to specify vector fields for the full robot pose when the task is defined in operational space. Recent advances in reactive motion generation have shown that learning adaptive, reactive, smooth, and stable vector fields is possible. However, these approaches define vector fields on a flat Euclidean manifold, while representing vector fields for orientations requires modeling the dynamics in non-Euclidean manifolds, such as Lie Groups. In this paper, we present a novel vector field model that can guarantee most of the properties of previous approaches i.e., stability, smoothness, and reactivity beyond the Euclidean space. In the experimental evaluation, we show the performance of our proposed vector field model to learn stable vector fields for full robot poses as SE(2) and SE(3) in both simulated and real robotics tasks.},

  title     = {{Hybrid Feedback for Global Tracking on Matrix Lie Groups SO(3) and SE(3)}},
  journal   = {IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control},
  abstract  = {We introduce a new hybrid control strategy, which is conceptually different from the commonly used synergistic hybrid approaches, to efficiently deal with the problem of the undesired equilibria that precludes smooth vectors fields on SO(3) from achieving global stability. The key idea consists in constructing a suitable potential function on SO(3)× R involving an auxiliary scalar variable, with flow and jump dynamics, which keeps the state away from the undesired critical points while, at the same time, guarantees a decrease of the potential function over the flows and jumps. Based on this new hybrid mechanism, a hybrid feedback control scheme for the attitude tracking problem on SO(3), endowed with global asymptotic stability and semiglobal exponential stability guarantees, is proposed. This control scheme is further improved through a smoothing mechanism that removes the discontinuities in the input torque. The third hybrid control scheme, proposed in this article, removes the requirement of the angular velocity measurements, while preserving the strong stability guarantees of the first hybrid control scheme. This approach has also been applied to the tracking problem on SE(3) to illustrate its advantages with respect to the existing synergistic hybrid approaches. Finally, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed hybrid controllers.},

  title         = {{Singularity-free guiding vector field for robot navigation}},
  journal       = {IEEE Transactions on Robotics},
  abstract      = {In robot navigation tasks, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) highway traffic monitoring, it is important for a mobile robot to follow a specified desired path. However, most of the existing path-following navigation algorithms cannot guarantee global convergence to desired paths or enable following self-intersected desired paths due to the existence of singular points where navigation algorithms return unreliable or even no solutions. One typical example arises in vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) navigation algorithms. These algorithms are based on a vector field, and the singular points are exactly where the vector field diminishes. Conventional VF-PF algorithms generate a vector field of the same dimensions as those of the space where the desired path lives. In this article, we show that it is mathematically impossible for conventional VF-PF algorithms to achieve global convergence to desired paths that are self-intersected or even just simple closed (precisely, homeomorphic to the unit circle). Motivated by this new impossibility result, we propose a novel method to transform self-intersected or simple closed desired paths to nonself-intersected and unbounded (precisely, homeomorphic to the real line) counterparts in a higher dimensional space. Corresponding to this new desired path, we construct a singularity-free guiding vector field on a higher dimensional space. The integral curves of this new guiding vector field is thus exploited to enable global convergence to the higher dimensional desired path, and therefore the projection of the integral curves on a lower dimensional subspace converge to the physical (lower dimensional) desired path. Rigorous theoretical analysis is carried out for the theoretical results using dynamical systems theory. In addition, we show both by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations that our proposed method is an extension combining conventional VF-PF algorithms and trajectory tracking algorithms. Finally, to show the practical value of our proposed approach for complex engineering systems, we conduct outdoor experiments with a fixed-wing airplane in windy environment to follow both 2-D and 3-D desired paths.},

  title         = {{Topological Analysis of Vector-Field Guided Path Following on Manifolds}},
  journal       = {IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control},
  abstract      = {A path-following control algorithm enables a system's trajectories under its guidance to converge to and evolve along a given geometric desired path. There exist various such algorithms, but many of them can only guarantee local convergence to the desired path in its neighborhood. In contrast, the control algorithms using a well-designed guiding vector field can ensure almost global convergence of trajectories to the desired path; here, 'almost' means that in some cases, a measure-zero set of trajectories converge to the singular set where the vector field becomes zero (with all other trajectories converging to the desired path). In this article, we first generalize the guiding vector field from the Euclidean space to a general smooth Riemannian manifold. This generalization can deal with path-following in some abstract configuration space (such as robot arm joint space). Then, we show several theoretical results from a topological viewpoint. Specifically, we are motivated by the observation that singular points of the guiding vector field exist in many examples where the desired path is homeomorphic to the unit circle, but it is unknown whether the existence of singular points always holds in general (i.e., is inherent in the topology of the desired path). In the {\$}n{\$}-dimensional Euclidean space, we provide an affirmative answer, and conclude that it is not possible to guarantee global convergence to desired paths that are homeomorphic to the unit circle. Furthermore, we show that there always exist nonpath-converging trajectories (i.e., trajectories that do not converge to the desired path) starting from the boundary of a ball containing the desired path in an {\$}n{\$}-dimensional Euclidean space where {\$}n \backslashgeq 3{\$}. Examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},
